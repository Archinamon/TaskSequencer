# TaskSequencer

Small, simple and powerfull annotation-based wrapper will buitifully organize and handle common background runnable tasks. This library supports a pre- and post-conditions, declaring as simple methods. Tune every single task in way you need to use it and don't worry about context references by disallowing synthetic class declaration!

Designed to be useful in building and configuring Ui where always a lot of asynchronous tasks which needs a delivery point into ui-thread. Organizing as sequences will help you to hold all logic apart within only one class per chain.

Usage
-------

First you have to add maven repo web-link to your `build.gradle` file:
```groovy
buildscript {
    repositories {
        maven { url 'https://github.com/Archinamon/TaskSequencer/raw/master/' }
    }
}

repositories {
    maven { url 'https://github.com/Archinamon/TaskSequencer/raw/master/' }
}
```
And then add a dependency:
```groovy
dependencies {
    compile 'com.archinamon:libsequencer:1.0'
}
```

That's all you need to start!

Simple sequence looks as a trivial synthetic inner class, annotated as `@Sequence`. All methods annotated as `@SequenceTask` will execute as a separate `Runnable` task synchronous to Ui thread group in order methods declared in class. To manipulate the order and execution (Ui or background) — simply add corresponding values to annotations.

```java
package com.example.sequence;

import android.app.Activity;

import com.archinamon.Mode;
import com.archinamon.ISequencer;
import com.archinamon.Sequence;
import com.archinamon.SequenceBuilder;
import com.archinamon.SequenceTask;
import com.archinamon.SequenceTask.Order;
import com.archinamon.SequenceTask.Type;

import org.jetbrains.annotations.Contract;

public class MyActivity extends Activity {

    @Sequence
    final class FillUi {

        @SequenceTask
        void fillViews() {}

        @SequenceTask(Type.ASYNC)
        void extractDb() {}

        @SequenceTask(exec_order = Order.POST_COMPILE)
        void updateUi() {}

        @Contract("-> !null")
        private Object helperMethod() {return new Object();}
    }
    
    private ISequencer mSequencer;
    
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCrate(savedInstanceState);
        
        mSequencer = new SequenceBuilder(this)
                .parseSequence(new FillUi())
                .build(Mode.COHERENCE);
    }
    
    protected void onResume() {
        super.onResume();
        
        mSequencer.exec();
    }
}
```

In this example I've used a separate class as seuence. You can use an easier way — adding to `SequenceBuilder` method references (or runnables if you use 1.7 and lower Java version) via `SequenceBuilder.addTask` methods. There're two additional methods (and parameters within `@SequenceTask` annotation too) to define a pre- and post-execution task order. I.e. to configurate a view or prepare some types before all other tasks will run. These two tasks have an absolute exec. order over all others.

After you fill the sequence you have to choose what mode to use to execute these tasks. The most common way is to build `ISequencer` with `Mode.COHERENCE` — in this case all tasks will be executed one-by-one, every task will await the previous. A `Mode.ONEWAY` will be useful if all the tasks could be executed in parallel mode.

There's an additional parameter for `@Sequence` annotation — `boolean synthetic() default true;`. This value is used to guard a class definition as inner one. If you're worry about memory usage and wanna be sure that a Sequence-class won't hold your activity against GC — declare this class as `static` or in a separate file and change a bit an annotation: `@Sequence(synthetic = false)`. If you'll try to declare this sequence as an inner class without `static` keyword — `SequenceBuilder` will throw an exception.
